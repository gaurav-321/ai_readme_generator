# AI README Generator

✨ **Project Title:** AI README Generator

🚀 **Description:**
The AI README Generator is an open-source tool that automates the generation, enhancement, and summarization of README files for GitHub repositories. It leverages GitHub API to fetch file data and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create meaningful content.

🛠️ **Installation:**
To get started with the AI README Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gag3301v/ai_readme_generator.git
   cd ai_readme_generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GitHub token:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   DEBUG=True  # Optional: enable debug logging
   ```

🔧 **Configuration:**
- The `config.py` file loads environment variables from a `.env` file and sets up HTTP headers for authentication.
- The `github_api.py` script interacts with the GitHub API to fetch repository information.
- The `summarizer.py` file uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate summaries of text prompts.

🧪 **Tests:**
To run tests, execute:
```bash
pytest
```
